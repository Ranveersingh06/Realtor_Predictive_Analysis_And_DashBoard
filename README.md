# Realtor_Predictive_Analysis_And_DashBoard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real estate data to predict property prices and visualize key market trends. By leveraging data scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards, the project aims to provide valuable insights for real estate stakeholders.

## Repository Contents
**realtor-data.csv:** Raw dataset containing property listings with features such as location, size, price, and amenities.​

**cleaned_realtor_data.csv:** Preprocessed dataset after cleaning and feature engineering.​

**Selenium.ipynb:** Notebook demonstrating data scraping techniques using Selenium to extract real estate data from online platforms.​

**EDA_Operations.ipynb:** Notebook performing exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.​

**Predictive_Analysis_Model.ipynb:** Notebook implementing predictive models, including XGBoost and Random Forest, to estimate property prices based on various features.​

**Realtor_Analysis_DashBoard.pbix:** Power BI dashboard providing interactive visualizations of the real estate market analysis.​

## Key Features
### Data Collection:

Utilized Selenium to scrape real estate listings from platforms like Realtor.com.​
Collected data on property prices, square footage, locations, and amenities.​
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and removed outliers.​
Normalized features such as square footage and price for consistency.​
The Close

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized correlations between price and features like size and neighborhood.​
Identified trends such as higher prices in downtown areas and seasonal fluctuations.​
### Predictive Modeling:

Developed XGBoost and Random Forest models to predict property prices.​
Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².​
### Interactive Dashboard:

Created a Power BI dashboard with filters to explore price trends across regions and property types.​
Displayed KPIs such as average price per square foot and total listings.​
## Insights
**Location Impact**: Properties in downtown areas are priced 20-30% higher than those in suburban regions.​

**Size vs. Price**: Larger properties (above 3,000 sq ft) command a premium of 15-25% on average.​

**Seasonal Trends**: Real estate prices typically increase during spring and summer, with slight declines in winter.​

**Market Shifts**: Urban areas like New York and San Francisco are experiencing price surges due to gentrification.​

**Amenities Influence**: Homes with features like pools or home offices can have a price premium of up to 10%.​

**Economic Factors**: Fluctuations in interest rates directly affect property prices, influencing market growth and affordability.​
